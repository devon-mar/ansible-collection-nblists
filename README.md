# NetBox Lists Collection for Ansible

This collection contains a single lookup plugin which provides easy access to the [NetBox lists plugin](https://github.com/devon-mar/netbox-lists).

The NetBox lists plugin provides a simple API to access and filter IPs/prefixes in NetBox. Combined with the lookup plugin,
you can easily use NetBox as a source of truth in your Ansible playbooks.

See the documentation [here](https://devon-mar.github.io/ansible-collection-nblists/collections/devon_mar/nblists/list_lookup.html) for usage information and examples.
